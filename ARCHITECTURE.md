# eink-frame — Architecture & Handoff

A digital photo frame system: Google Photos → Raspberry Pi 4 server → custom-firmware
e-paper frame over LAN.

This document captures all decisions made before code was written, so future work
doesn't re-litigate them.

## Hardware

**Display side**

- Frame: Seeed Studio XIAO ePaper DIY Kit EE02
- SoC: ESP32-S3 Plus (XIAO ESP32-S3 Plus module, 8 MB PSRAM)
- Panel: 13.3" E Ink Spectra 6, 1600 × 1200, 6 colors (black, white, yellow, red, green, blue)
- Interface: SPI to panel via 60-pin FFC
- Refresh: ~12 seconds, no partial refresh (intrinsic to Spectra 6)
- Firmware: ESP-IDF (custom, separate project — out of scope for the server repo)

**Server side**

- Raspberry Pi 4 Model B (4 GB RAM, ARM64/aarch64)
- Raspberry Pi OS (64-bit) or Ubuntu 22.04 LTS ARM64
- Container runtime: Docker CE (standard bridge networking)

## High-level flow

Key property: **the user-driven picker is the only way new photos enter the
system.** There is no watched-album sync — the Google Photos Library API
deprecated that capability on March 31, 2025. Refreshing the queue is a
deliberate human action triggered every few weeks from a phone.

## Decisions and rationale

### Why Google Photos Picker API (not Library API, not shared link scraping, not self-hosted)

- Library API no longer permits reading photos the app didn't upload itself
  (deprecated 2025-03-31).
- Shared-link scraping works but is fragile and arguably against ToS.
- Self-hosting (Immich, PhotoPrism) was considered but rejected — the user
  wants Google Photos as the canonical source.
- Picker API is the official, supported path. Trade-off: manual selection
  every refresh; no automatic ongoing sync.

### Why Node.js (not Python)

- Stack is OAuth + HTTP + image processing + small web UI. Both ecosystems handle
  this well.
- `googleapis` npm package is well-maintained.
- One language across server + any future browser-side tooling.
- The image-processing piece (epdoptimize) is itself a Node/TypeScript library
  that the user found and validated visually. Using it directly avoids a
  cross-language port.

### Why Docker (not bare Node on the Pi)

- Container pins the Node version and all system libraries (libvips for sharp,
  etc.) independently of the host OS. Pi OS upgrades don't break the app.
- Restart policy, volume management, and deployment are handled by compose —
  no systemd unit file needed.
- Same Dockerfile runs on the dev machine and the Pi (both ARM64 when developing
  on Apple Silicon; add `--platform linux/amd64` only if developing on x86_64).

### Why an in-house port of epdoptimize (not the npm dep, not a custom-from-scratch ditherer)

The original plan was to use `epdoptimize` (paperlesspaper) as a dependency.
That plan was revised: the relevant pieces are ported in-house under
`src/imaging/`, keeping the algorithms and palette data verbatim but reshaping
the I/O.

Why epdoptimize's algorithms (vs. a naive ditherer):

- Two-palette system: dithers against measured/calibrated panel colors, then
  swaps to native device colors at output. Without this, the algorithm doesn't
  know the panel's "red" actually displays as brick/maroon, and quality suffers.
- LAB color matching (vs. naive RGB Euclidean distance).
- LAB lightness dynamic range compression — addresses the single biggest issue
  with limited-palette displays (photos crushing into pure black/white).
- Tone mapping (exposure, saturation, S-curve) tuned for e-paper.
- Floyd-Steinberg error diffusion with serpentine scanning. Other kernels
  (Atkinson, Stucki, Jarvis, Sierra, Burkes) are easy to port if needed.
- Battle-tested: epdoptimize is published by paperlesspaper, who sell Spectra 6
  frames commercially and use this library in their product.

Why port instead of `npm install`:

- **Drops the `canvas` (node-canvas) native dep entirely.** epdoptimize's public
  API takes a `CanvasLike` (just `getImageData` / `putImageData`); under the
  hood it operates on a `Uint8ClampedArray` of RGBA bytes. We feed it raw
  `sharp` output directly. Cairo/Pango/libjpeg/librsvg are no longer required
  on the host — a meaningful simplification for the Synology install, where
  the original Docker rationale was largely "node-canvas is awkward on bare DSM".
- Full understanding of the pipeline; trivial to tweak per-image parameters or
  swap kernels for our specific panel without forking and republishing.

Skipped (vs. upstream): the image classifier (`image-style.ts`,
`auto-processing.ts`, ~1200 lines) and the preset zoo. We hardcode one
processing config and adjust by hand. Can be added later if visual results
suggest auto-tuning is worth the complexity.

Starting palette: `aitjcize-spectra6`, copied verbatim from epdoptimize's
`default-palettes.json`. Plan to recalibrate once the physical panel is in
hand by adjusting the calibrated `color` values; the two-palette format makes
this a config change, not a code change.

### Why LAN-only, no auth

- Single-user system on a trusted home network.
- No need to expose to the internet — Picker API uses outbound calls from
  the NAS to Google.
- Reduces attack surface and operational complexity. Can revisit if needs
  change.

## Server architecture

### Stack

```
node:20-alpine
├── express              — HTTP server (port 8765)
├── googleapis           — OAuth2 client + token refresh
├── sharp                — resize + smart-crop, raw RGBA I/O (libvips)
└── qrcode               — render pickerUri as QR for the phone

In-house, src/imaging/:
├── palette.ts           — aitjcize-spectra6 calibrated/device color pairs
├── colorspace.ts        — RGB <-> LAB, deltaE, luma709
├── toneMap.ts           — exposure / saturation / contrast / S-curve / LAB DRC
├── dither.ts            — Floyd-Steinberg error diffusion + serpentine scan
├── replaceColors.ts     — exact-match calibrated -> device swap
└── pipeline.ts          — orchestrates resize + tone map + dither + replace + 3bpp pack
```

Optional: `node-cron` if a periodic cleanup or token-refresh task is wanted.

### Endpoints (all LAN-only, no auth)

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| GET | `/` | Status page: queue size, last refresh time, "Refresh from Google Photos" button |
| GET | `/pick` | Creates picker session, returns page with QR code + clickable pickerUri |
| GET | `/pick/status` | Polled by `/pick` page; reports `pending` / `processing` / `done` with counts |
| GET | `/next.bin` | ESP32 endpoint. Returns one packed framebuffer (random pick from queue), `application/octet-stream` |
| POST | `/admin/clear` | Wipes queue. Manual recovery. |

### Persistent data

Container path `/app/data` ← bind-mounted from host `./data` (relative to repo root on the Pi).

```
/app/data/
├── tokens.json          # OAuth refresh token (chmod 600)
├── queue/
│   ├── <hash>.bin       # packed 3bpp framebuffer ready for the panel
│   └── ...
└── cache/               # optional — original downloaded JPEGs, for re-processing
    ├── <mediaItemId>.jpg
    └── ...
```

The `data/` directory is the only thing the user backs up. Code lives in git;
the container is rebuilt from the Dockerfile.

### Image pipeline (per picked photo)

1. Download bytes from picker `baseUrl` with current OAuth access token.
   Append `=w1600-h1200` for server-side resizing on Google's side as a hint.
2. `sharp(buffer).resize(1600, 1200, { fit: 'cover', position: 'attention' })
   .raw().toBuffer()` — smart crop using saliency detection, returns a raw
   RGBA buffer wrapped as `{ width, height, data: Uint8ClampedArray }`.
3. Apply tone mapping in place: exposure, saturation, then either contrast or
   S-curve depending on preset.
4. Apply LAB lightness dynamic range compression toward the calibrated
   palette's black/white luminance window.
5. Floyd-Steinberg error diffusion with serpentine scan, quantizing each pixel
   to the nearest palette color via ΔE in LAB.
6. Walk the buffer and replace each calibrated palette color with its device
   color counterpart.
7. Pack each pixel to a palette index (0-5) and write to `queue/<hash>.bin`.
   Exact packing layout TBD — the firmware spec drives this. Two candidates:
   true 3bpp (8 px per 3 bytes, ~720 KB at 1600×1200) or 4bpp nibble-packed
   (~960 KB at 1600×1200, simpler ESP32-side).
8. Optionally save the source JPG to `cache/`.

For each step the dev CLI can dump an intermediate PNG (sharp re-encodes the
buffer) so visual regressions are easy to spot.

### Frame model

- Frame wakes on its own RTC timer (firmware-side concern, every few hours).
- `GET /next.bin` → server picks a random `.bin` from the queue, streams it back.
- Server never returns 404 unless queue is empty. Random includes possible
  repeats — no "don't show same photo twice in a row" logic in v1.
- ESP32 reads bytes directly into panel buffer, triggers refresh, deep sleeps.
- 720 KB transfer over WiFi is trivial compared to the 12-second panel refresh.

## Raspberry Pi 4 deployment notes

1. **Enable SSH** on first boot (via raspi-config or the imager's advanced settings) for headless access.
2. **Install Docker CE** — use the official convenience script or the apt repo; avoid the snap version.
3. **64-bit OS required.** `node:20-alpine` on ARM64 needs a 64-bit kernel. Use Raspberry Pi OS (64-bit) or Ubuntu 22.04 LTS ARM64.
4. **Port 8765 is free** on a stock Pi OS. No reserved-port conflicts to worry about.
5. **Apple Silicon dev builds natively.** Both the Pi 4 and M-series Macs are ARM64, so the same image runs on both without a `--platform` flag. Only x86_64 dev machines need `--platform linux/arm64/v8`.
6. **Bridge networking works normally.** The `ports:` mapping in compose is all that's needed — no `network_mode: host` required.

## Out of scope for v1

- Multi-user (the entire system assumes one OAuth identity)
- Authentication on LAN endpoints
- Watched-album auto-sync (Picker API forbids this)
- Calibration UI (will manually edit palette JSON once panel is in hand)
- Pre-computing multiple aspect-ratio variants (assume crop-to-fill is fine)
- HTTPS (LAN only)
- Web UI for queue management beyond clear-all
- Frame firmware (separate project, separate repo)

## Development workflow

1. Develop and test locally on the dev machine. Don't develop on the Pi.
2. End-to-end milestones, in order:
   - **Milestone 1**: CLI script — create picker session, print URL, poll, download bytes. No Express, no Docker yet. Validates Google's flow.
   - **Milestone 2**: Add the image pipeline. Process one downloaded photo end-to-end into a `.bin` file. Verify visually as PNG before binary packing.
   - **Milestone 3**: Wrap in Express. Add `/`, `/pick`, `/pick/status`, `/next.bin`. Test from a browser and `curl`.
   - **Milestone 4**: Dockerize. Test container locally on dev machine.
   - **Milestone 5**: Deploy to NAS. Verify auto-restart, persistence, ESP32 fetches.
3. Use git from milestone 1.
4. OAuth client setup is browser-only — Google Cloud Console, enable Photos
   Picker API, create "Desktop app" OAuth client, add yourself as a test user
   while the consent screen is in Testing status.
5. While the consent screen stays in Testing, refresh tokens expire after
   7 days. For long-term use, either submit for verification or accept weekly
   re-auth.

## Calibration plan (post-panel-arrival)

1. Display a known reference (e.g., a calibration card or test pattern image)
   on the panel using `aitjcizeSpectra6Palette` as-is.
2. Photograph the panel under neutral daylight or a known light source.
3. Sample the actual rendered colors for each of the 6 primaries.
4. Replace the `color` values in the palette JSON with measured values.
   Leave `deviceColor` values untouched.
5. Reprocess test images and compare. Iterate.
